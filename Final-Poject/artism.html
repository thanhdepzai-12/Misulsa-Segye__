  <h1>Impressionism (1874- 1886)</h1>
    <p>Appears from the late 1800s, specifically beginning in 1874, when a group of artists in Paris together exhibited small, informal paintings. Art critics immediately used the name of Claude Monet's work, Impression, Dawn (Impression, Sunrise, oil painting, 1872) to name the group. And so the name [[Impressionist - Impressionists] became the name accepted by the whole group of artists[1].

        The highlight of the group is bright and fresh colors, with a fresh view of the world, in which the world is displayed through shimmering blobs of all kinds.
        
        Most of the subjects and subjects for painting by Impressionists are modern, representing the boulevards and entertainment districts of Paris, or the suburban landscape filled with tourists and industry.
        
        In terms of technique, it can be seen that artists break the traditional way of painting with all objects, using short strokes, diverse color strokes (stroke, taché) to capture the comprehensive landscape of the scene. "They often also don't pay much attention to the details of each object shown on the picture. Most Impressionist painters paint with the contrast - contrast - of colors, sometimes with very strong collisions. They also removed the rule of drawing warm colors on a dark blue background, refusing to apply the classical painting method that valued the light - dark effect expressed through light - dark colors or tones"[1].</p>

          <h1>Post Impressionism 1886- 1910</h1>
          <p>Post-Impressionism is the collective name for artists of the post-Impressionist period. Impressionism was a turning point in painting, shedding the notions that had existed for many years in Europe. From post-impressionism, many independent artists explore creativity and go in different directions. Although they do not have the same compositional style, they are collectively known as post-impressionist. This term was coined by the British critic Roger Fry to refer to such painters as Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Vincent Van Gogh. The study of these painters also reveals the development of French art of the late 20th century.[1]</p>

                  <h1>Cubism (1909-1926)</h1>
                  <p>Cubism, also known as Cubism, is a school of painting that revolutionized European painting and sculpture in the early 20th century.

                    In the cubist's work, the object is dissected, analyzed, and recombined in an abstract form. The artist does not observe the subject at a fixed angle, but at the same time divides it into many different sides, many different aspects. Usually surfaces, planes intersect each other not according to the rules of perspective, making it difficult for the viewer to realize the depth of the picture.</p>

                          <h1>Surrealism</h1>
                         <p>Surrealism derives from Surrealism, which focuses on exploiting the unconscious mind. Their favorite subjects are myth and primitivism. Although it is no more, this style still maintains its influence to this day.

                            The Surrealist image in this school is the first and most recognizable form. However, it is also the most elusive ingredient to categorize and identify. Each artist will present his Surrealist paintings with images arising in dreams or unconsciously. These images are often strange, confusing, and somewhat bizarre.
                            
                            Besides, nature is the most common part of Surrealist works.</p>
