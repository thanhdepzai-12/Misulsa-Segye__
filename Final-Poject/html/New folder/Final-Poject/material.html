    <h1>watercolor</h1>
    <p>Watercolor is a material used in painting, and watercolor painting is a popular painting technique. Watercolors form when pigments (usually in the form of powders) are dissolved in water to produce a colored solution. The most popular and traditional performance material associated with watercolor is paper, in addition to papyrus, plastic, parchment, leather, canvas, and wood. The basic properties of watercolors are transparency and lightness, as well as the purity and intensity of the pigments. These properties are due to the fact that thin layers of color are always placed on the paper and thus the layers become transparent to light rays passing through. In some East Asian countries, watercolor paintings are painted with inks called ink paintings. In the traditional painting of China, Vietnam, Japan and Korea, watercolor paintings are mainly ink paintings using only one color of black or brown. India, Ethiopia and many other countries also have the ancient art of watercolor painting.</p>
